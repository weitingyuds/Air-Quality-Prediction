# Air-Quality-Prediction
Goal of this project is to predict the type of activity with indoor gas concentration data
This dataset contains indoor gas concentration level collected by 6 low cost sensors
First 6 columns represent data from MQ sensors
Last column indicates the action that generated the values ​​acquired by the sensors
1 - Normal situation - Activity: clean air, a person sleeping or studying or resting - Samples: 595;

2 - Preparing meals - Activities: cooking meat or pasta, fried vegetables. One or two people in the room, forced air circulation - Samples: 515.

3 - Presence of smoke - Activity: burning paper and wood for a short period of time in a room with closed windows and doors - Example: 195.

4 - Cleaning - Activity: use of spray and liquid detergents with ammonia and / or alcohol. Forced air circulation can be activated or deactivated - Samples: 540.
